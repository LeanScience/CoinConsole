# Thanks for your interest in contributing to the development of the CoinConsole!

I really do want to extend my appreciation for any and all help on this project. I have a deep passion for code, and an even deeper passion for open source projects -- especially applications that run in the web. Hopefully you feel the same way, and that's probably why you're reading this file!

Aside from web applications and open source projects, I want to do *something* with cryptocurrency. I know it's the future and I can see that the internet (and even entire societies) is moving towards a more decentralized approached to the way that everything works. There is a revolution, and there's nothing more exciting during a revolution than fresh ideas battling against one another. The current (4.11.2017) CoinConsole is the very simple, humble, <1000-lines-of-code start to a potential platform for cryptocurrency users everywhere that will be one contestant of all of those projects that participate in the battle.

## Guidelines
Before contributing to the CoinConsole repo, please make sure that you have read the following guidelines below in order to increase the chance that your request will get merged or your issue will be resolved.

### Pull requests
When contributing code to this repo, I ask that you **submit all pull requests to the 'dev' branch**. Should your request be merged, it will be then be included in the next merge to the production branch, which I will then pull to the server that the public application runs on (see [coinconsole.com](http://coinconsole.com). If you fail to submit the pull request to the dev branch, I will deny it and personally ask you to read these very guidlines and then submit your request to the proper branch (dev).

Also, please make sure that you write a clear title and description for your pull request. Some more guidelines will come soon that will provide some extra clarity into what I mean, but for now please just submit exactly what your changes were. Leave it up to me to figure out how they work and interact with the previously written code.

### Issues
When submitting an issue to the issue list, please make sure that you select the correct label(s) for that issue. If you need help deciding which label to submit the issue under, use this list:

* **Bug**: Something is broken! Perhaps the buttons don't work properly or there is an error message in your browser's JavaScript console.
* **Duplicate**: There is already an issue out there with a similar problem in it.
* **Enhancement**: New feature, or an adjustment to a current feature that will improve it.
* **Future**: This issue will be addressed in the next version of the application -- these are typically larger issues or issues that can be thrown on the virtual backburner.
* **Help Wanted**: Feel extra free to contribue to these one's especially! This issue will probably be something that I'm not familiar with coding or will simply take some extra brainpower (and code) to efficiently make it happen
* **Question**: Simple; a question.
* **Wontfix**: Rarely used - only used for issues that we don't feel should not be in the application or will be obsolete in the next version
* **Invalid**: It just doesn't even pertain to this repository. It's, for whatever reason, complete nonsense.

If there is another issue that is related to yours in any way, such as a "fix this first before addressing this issue" or "this issue is related to mine", please include the issue number by typing '#' and the issue number (ex. #15, #134) so that we may navigate to it quickly instead of searching around for the issue that you're referring to in your description.

Please note that the issue labels may be updated in the future, at which point this file will be updated to include and compensate for any added/removed/modified labels.

### Milestones
*Coming soon... we haven't really made use of them quite yet...*
